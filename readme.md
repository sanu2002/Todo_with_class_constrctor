Friendly Reminder for React Users: Building a Todo App with Local Storage
Introduction
Creating a todo app in React that utilizes local storage involves understanding key JavaScript concepts. Here's a friendly reminder to help you navigate through the process.

Key JavaScript Concepts:
Array (JS):

Utilize JavaScript arrays to manage and store your todo items efficiently.
MAP (JS):

Leverage the map function to iterate through arrays and perform operations on each element.
FILTER():

Use the filter function to selectively extract elements from an array based on specified conditions.
reduce():

Explore the reduce function to accumulate values in an array and obtain a single result.
Loop:

Understand how loops (e.g., for or while) can simplify repetitive tasks when working with arrays.
Accessing Keys from Objects:

Learn how to access keys within objects, especially when dealing with todo items stored as objects.
Implementation Steps:
1. Array of Todo Objects:
Store your todo items as objects within an array.
2. Mapping and Filtering:
Use map to iterate over the array, rendering each todo item.
Employ filter to manage todo items based on completion status or other criteria.
3. Reducing for Summary:
Utilize reduce to calculate statistics, such as the total number of completed todos.
4. Looping for Iteration:
Implement loops for various tasks, such as iterating through arrays or performing repetitive operations.
5. Accessing Object Keys:
Understand how to access and manipulate keys within objects to retrieve essential information.
